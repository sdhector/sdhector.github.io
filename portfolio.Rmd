## Complete Projects: 

[Advertising Budget Optimization: An application of Marketing Mix Modelling and Linear Programming](http://sdhector.github.io/Case1_Advertising_Budget_Optimization.nb.html):
  
In this example I show how to use a Least Square regression to estimate the effect that a number of variables -- such as the channel, the length of the commercial, the day of the week and the hour -- have on sales. Afterwards, I use these results to decide how many commercials to schedule and where, by solving a constrained linear opimization problem using Linear Programming and the lp_solve package. 
## Working Projects: 

[Customer Churn Prediction](http://sdhector.github.io/Chur_Modelling.html):

Here I am using a [sample dataset](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/using-customer-behavior-data-to-improve-customer-retention/) from IBM Watson Analytics to replicate the Churn Modelling project I did at my previous employer, Claro. The dataset has a Class-Imbalance problem, and I solve it by Under Sampling the dominant class. I perform an exploratory analysis in order to identify meaningful predictors of churn, and then use a Logistic Regression to predict who churned and who didn't. Finally, I evaluate the model's performance with by cross-validating with a hold-out sample. 

[Customer Satisfaction Indices and the Weather](http://sdhector.github.io/cs_paper.html): 

This is more of an academic project. I am working with a former colleague to publish a paper discussing something we found using internal data when I was working at Claro. Customer Satisfaction Indices -- including the infamous NPS (Net Promoter Score) -- should not be taken at face value without first correcting for several biases; amongst them is the effect of weather patterns across time. 

## Upcoming Projects: 

[Marketing KPI Dashboard]()

Using an [IBM Watson sample dataset](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/analyze-sales-effectivness/), I will construct a Static Dashboard using R Markdown -- instead of Watson -- which is meant to represent the KPI reporting I used to do at Claro for the Fixed Line Internet Line of Business. 

[Determinants of Brand Choice in the Mobile Telecom Category: Using Conjoint Analysis and Discrete Choice Models]()

Here I will design a conjoint experiment and use Logistic Regression to estimate the impact of the features on consumer choice. The beautiful thing about this project is that I can collect the data myself through personal or internet surveys. 

[Measuring the return of advertising expenditure using Marketing Mix Modelling]()

I have already used done something similar to this in [another project](http://sdhector.github.io/Case1_Advertising_Budget_Optimization.nb.html), but this time I want to go deeper into the MMM methodology; specifically with respect to the lagged effect of advertising. There data for this comes from the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL).

[An Optimal Store Location Model]()

I created this model in order to answer the question of which stores my previous employer should close. I basically defined the territory in terms of the telecommunication towers of the company, and iteratively decided where to open a store. The result is an optimal network of stores, and any store not in it should be closed. 

[Marketing Research Projects]()

This section is meant to contain a number of examples of simple Marketing Research concepts explained theoretically, and then practically using anonimized data I have available from my previous consulting projects. Some of the topics I cover are: 

  * Brand Awareness
  * Advertising Awareness
  * Purchase habits
  * Brand Choice Drivers 
  * Public Opinion
  * Voting Intentions
  * Customer Satisfaction
  * Lifestyle habits
