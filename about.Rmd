title: "A little more about me"
---

My name is Hector Sanchez. I was born in the district of Ban√≠, in the Peravia Province, in the Dominican Republic. I studied Marketing at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica y Maestra and soon I noticed my preference for supporting business decisions with data and analytics. For that reason, I chose to closest career path to do just that in Marketing Research. I went on to do several projects at a small agency called MKT Global. After a small brake due to my Bachelor's Thesis,  I went on to work for an international agency called Dichter-Neira. After a year I got an offer to work as Senior Marketing Intelligence Anayst at Claro. Up to this point, I had seen several projects and felt that they were too simple. In hindisght, my perception of these projects as too simple actually meant that they were too ad-hoc. While it is true that there are particular differences between one project an another, pretending like they are all different is pointless, ineficient and also false. There are commonalities and for that specific analysis have been developed and shown to be effective. Looking for this, I went on to do a Specialization in Statistics Applied to Business at the Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo. I did find what I was looking for in Statistical Modelling and Econometrics, which I went on to apply at work in a series of quite interesting projects. I will go on to these projects in more detail in other sections of these websites, so I will just mention them by name here. I first participated in a project using Conjoint Analysis of the Choice Based variety. We went on to do a second project using this methodology in order to measure Brand Equity. Another methodology I explored was using Marketing Mix Models based on Time Series Econometrics. Using Logistic Regression, I also participated in developing a Churn Prediction Model. I also worked to explore the relationship between Satisfaction and Recommendation Indices with the weather and the economy. Finally, I managed to create a rudimentary model in excel that suggests where on the map to open, or close, stores.
