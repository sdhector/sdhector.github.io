  title: "About"

I'm Hector, and I come from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I have BA in Marketing from the [PUCMM](https://pucmm.edu.do/), a Specialization in Statistics Applied to Business from the [INTEC](http://www.intec.edu.do/) and  MSc in Economics from the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/). 

Professionally, I would describe myself as a Quantitative Researcher; someone who is able to define problems such that they can be solved using quantitative methods -- mathematical or statistical. My first experiences doing this were in the field of Market Research, but I have come to apply these principles to Operations, Social and Economic problems. 

My interests are very diverse. If you want to talk to me for hours, there are several topics to choose from. 

Starting with Philosophy, because I consider the fundamentals of logical argumentation extremely important in order to be consistent in our positions. Some branches of Philosophy I consider interesting are: Moral Philosophy, Epistemology, Ontology and the Philosophy of Science. 

Among the natual sciences I find Cosmology, Physics and Biology most interesting; among the social sciences, Economics, Sociology and (Behavioral) Psychology; and among management sciences, Marketing Science. 

When I'm not [dweling on the inmortality of the crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_about_the_immortality_of_the_crab), I'm usually on Youtube. There is great scientific/educational content there ... and also Dragon Ball Super ([this was epic](https://youtu.be/Eu8VWoe69aM?t=13m58s)). 

For entertainment I like watching TV Series (GoT, TWD, Vikings...), and I wish DC would be better than Marvel for once. I am a proud Boston Sports fan, and in particular of the New England Patriots -- whom are in the Super Bowl once more :)
