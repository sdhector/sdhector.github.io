title: "Hector's Website"

###Hello! Welcome to my Professional Website. 

#### Why do I have a website? 
This is meant to be an extended version of my Resume. It explains my work experience in more detail, including things that simply cannot be included in a one or two page CV even if including a motivation letter. 

It also serves as a place to host my Portfolio, which consists of projects where I have used some sort of quantitative analysis. 

#### So, what is there here? 
As you can see in the navigation bar, the first stop is to take a look at my Professional Timeline. This is where I describe the places I have worked at, what I have done and learnt there. 

After that, you can take a look at a more detailed description of the projects I have been involved in; what I call my Portfolio. 

#### There isn't that much going on here
I don't know if you would think this, but perhaps I have higher expectations of myself. The fact is that I just recently started creating this website on my spare time. Things get in the way - like laundry, ugh! - but I will slowly populate it with interesting content. 

Nevertheless, the simplest goal this website is able to achieve right now is to provide you with an extended view of my CV. 

### Newsflash! 
I have just uploaded my first portfolio case titles [*Advertising Budget Optimization: An application of Marketing Mix Modelling and Linear Programming*](http://sdhector.github.io/Case1_Advertising_Budget_Optimization.html)
