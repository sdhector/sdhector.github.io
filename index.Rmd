## A little about me
My name is Hector Sanchez and I come from the the Dominican Republic. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Marketing, a Specialization of Statistics Applied to Business and a Master of Science in Economics from the University of Konstanz, Germany. 

Nowadays, the title that better describes me is of "Quantitative Researcher". Early in my career I learned to use quantitative research techniques in the context of Market Research. I have since expanded my knowledge and could see myself applying it to problems in Marketing, Business, Economic, Social, or Operations Research. Due to my experience with data, I could also find myself in Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Data Mining, or Data Science. Further, it would be a natural progression from Economics to Quantitative Risk Management, Financial Econometrics, and Macroeconomic Forecasting. 

#### [My Portfolio](http://sdhector.github.io/portfolio.html)
The main purpose of this website is to showcase a number of projects where I exhibit my proficiency with R and with the appropiate methodologies to solve certain problems. Here you can find the projects I have completed, as well as some that are underway.
